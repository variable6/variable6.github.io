Hi, I'm Pranay kumar — a Software Engineer passionate about building scalable web and mobile applications that make a difference.
With over 3 years of professional experience, I've led engineering teams, architected microservice-based systems, and delivered robust solutions using technologies like React, Node.js, GraphQL, Flutter, and gRPC. From building real-time social platforms to mentoring junior engineers, I thrive at the intersection of clean code, performance, and collaboration.
I enjoy solving complex technical challenges and am constantly exploring new tools and frameworks to stay ahead in the ever-evolving tech world. Whether it's designing APIs, implementing responsive UI, or scaling backend services — I aim to build products that are both efficient and user-focused.
When I'm not coding, I love sharing knowledge, contributing to side projects, and exploring the latest in developer tooling and architecture.
Let's build something amazing together!
